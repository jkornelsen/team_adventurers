1. play event determined by pile quantity
query all items (or get_by_id) and all containers with non-zero piles of each item,
including general storage
[item_id]: [(container_type, container_id, quantity)]
query in pile.py
will also need container_name
[item_id]: [(container, quantity)]
container can be char, loc, item

2. play event changing a pile
items could work like attrs do now -- select container
list any possible since qty could start at 0: chars, locs, general storage
