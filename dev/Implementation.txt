don't allow production if byproducts would exceed limit

implement checking triggers for item progress
maybe in item_progress, similar to call in char_progress
event.check_trigger_for_duration(time_spent)
pop up event in play/item.html like in play/character.html

checkbox, not selected by default, "One-Way"
for different distances, create two rows -- normal just requires one
specify only source door coordinates when configuring loc of each side
for non-bidirectional, display as "(destination only)" when configuring loc2
maybe it would help to hide distance field in that case as well
i guess always show checkbox for loc1 config and not loc2 config?
that would be the only way to see which is which

locations.py line 239
    # XXX: What happens when we load data from both ends for JSON?
    # This will delete the other end and we won't be able to recreate
    # any that aren't bidirectional.
