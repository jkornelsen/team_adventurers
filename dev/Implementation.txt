lots of rows in progress with item_id 0
the item points to progress_id 1 while the IDs go all the way up to 20
are we creating a new progress row each time we do Item.complete_data()?
    item.py:126  to_db() for id=1
    db_serializable.py:177  called from db_serializable.py:335
        INSERT INTO progress (id, item_id, recipe_id, start_time, stop_time, batches_processed, is_ongoing, game_token)
        VALUES (COALESCE((SELECT MAX(id) + 1 FROM progress), 1),%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s,%s)
        ON CONFLICT (game_token, id) DO UPDATE
        SET item_id=EXCLUDED.item_id, recipe_id=EXCLUDED.recipe_id, start_time=EXCLUDED.start_time, stop_time=EXCLUDED.stop_time, batches_processed=EXCLUDED.batches_processed, is_ongoing=EXCLUDED.is_ongoing
        RETURNING id
        values=[0, 0, None, None, 0, False, '4d7515a6-7ad9-4fe0-9ea6-a86ba028a3be']
well, locations table does reference progress_id 15 and 20
characters has progress_id 2
so we do use the new IDs but neglect to remove or replace the old ones

implement checking triggers for item progress
maybe in item_progress, similar to call in char_progress
event.check_trigger_for_duration(time_spent)
pop up event in play/item.html like in play/character.html

items at location in configure are showing as "," rather than "0,0"

changing destinations shows full travel bar

rate didn't keep -- 0.5 in 8 became 1 in 3
looks like configuring item changes value in db correctly,
but then reconfiguring doesn't load changed values,
so saving that changes db data back to default
seems to be a common type of problem in this project
a read error that acts like a write error
