implement checking triggers for item progress
maybe in item_progress, similar to call in char_progress
event.check_trigger_for_duration(time_spent)

can a numeric attrib requirement be 0 or negative?
-1 was accepted because none was found, which is 0
but that doesn't make sense
maybe recipe_attribs should have min_val and max_val
    currently has "value real not null"
that would make it possible to specify an exact val
might want an AttribReq class derived from AttribFor
