implement checking triggers for item progress
maybe in item_progress, similar to call in char_progress
event.check_trigger_for_duration(time_spent)
pop up event in play/item.html like in play/character.html
we'll also want it for overview eventually

items at location in configure are showing as "," rather than "0,0"

changing destinations shows full travel bar

save default item type in item configure to session

change destination for travel companions

evt cfg isn't saving 0.0 as trigger chance

can an attrib requirement be 0 or negative?
-1 was accepted because none was found, which is 0
but that doesn't make sense

setting event range to (-10, 0) became (-10, 10)
presumably because 0 goes to default which seems to be 10

adding destination to new loc failed
probably need to grab new id and use to insert the dest

save play event min and max die form values
because otherwise we'll keep having to redo adjustments after rolling again
then we'll also need a button or something to set min and max to unadjusted
four-way difficulty select can do this but numeric has no way

dollars for lemonade stand suddenly lost its recipe, yet progress continued
I think this was during item play, not configure
