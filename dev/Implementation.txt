Saving duplicate item with recipe:
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "recipe_sources_pkey" DETAIL: Key (game_token, recipe_id, item_id)=(2611f107-0a28-4e4c-b3ca-037207f36c86, 8, 25) already exists.
still a problem? maybe it happened before 'this' references were fixed.

equipped slot on char configure should be a select box

probably should show triggerable events for item production
and any other events for that item
that would be useful for items such as the phone in the first scenario
try a separate table, like "used for"

don't show start/gain button unless conditions are met
instead, put a ðŸš«

after a batch is produced, call can_produce() before starting a new batch
and stop if there's no more to do
maybe in item_progress
