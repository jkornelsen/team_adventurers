hotkeys for starting recipes

don't allow production if byproducts would exceed limit

implement checking triggers for item progress
maybe in item_progress, similar to call in char_progress
event.check_trigger_for_duration(time_spent)
pop up event in play/item.html like in play/character.html

checkbox, selected by default, to create both directions for destination
removing deletes both
door coordinates are the same for both ends
specify only source door coordinates on each side
distance also will affect both unless box is unchecked
"make reverse direction the same"
