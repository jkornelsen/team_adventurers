hosting possibilities:
Pythonanywhere should be able to host postgres and flask web app.

render.com is an alternative.

prompt each player to save to their PC occasionally
only if no one recently saved from that session
warn that loading will erase any scenario currently being played, so save first

limit upload file size
for example 10 Mb
at 90% warn to remove content to avoid going over limit

try selenium to test client side

consider sharing community scenarios
perhaps submit to reddit, or github via enhancement requests

---- general gameplay ----

gain all instant could be more convenient than entering e.g. 9999 batches
maybe a button or 0 for number of batches, or "(A)ll"

first check if source item is carried,
then if on floor,
and finally, if in general storage
deduct whichever is found first
if say 5 are required, two are held and three are on floor,
then require the character to either pick up three or drop two

checkbox to mask items until gained or while none
replace all non-spaces with "*" or "?"
description "(hidden -- produce or find to reveal)"
conversation dialog via masked item sources
yes or no choice would consume a source

mask characters we haven't met yet
those not marked as maskable are the starting set
go to location to unmask all characters there

if a grid is defined then char must either be at same or adjacent pos
to pick up pile, use local item sources, or travel through door

travel could take a resource such as food for each distance step
the character object would have this resource
or use an instant item to do this manually
that would make it easier to take 1 ticket or Rs.5 per x distance

to travel from one location to another, selecting from a dropdown may
be a bit tedious
could have buttons instead to start travelling to a location
perhaps we could use those instead of a single start button
would still have a single stop button
only a single distance display as well
maybe display would include destination name: "Distance to Home: 3 of 10"
since button would simply show "Travelling."
other buttons would be greyed out if travelling.

would attributes be useful for locations?
for example, how dark a room is,
or deep water would require swimming or limit evasion
perhaps it would be better to simply mention such things in location description
however, this could replace crafting stations

for locations, have speed as well as distance
characters would have travel speed for a particular location?
for example, a swimming speed and a walking speed
speed for a particular type of terrain, and a location would have a type of terrain
or we could manually change the character's speed when entering a new location

base chances could be displayed in the form of 1 / 10000 ticks
or 3 / 5 chance to hit
also min and max result,
for example, 70% chance to do between 30 and 60 damage.

an attribute could be the season
so an event based on the season would have a worse chance or lower average
distance if season is winter
winter would be explained in the attr description,
and the implementation would be an input box showing * 0.9

events should automatically select last character viewed?
seems better to have select box to select from all lists
wouldn't change selection if a particular box doesn't have it
could only show for three or more -- "Select all"
seems good as long as we can find an intuitive place to put it on the page

if item play gets too cluttered we could make a recipe play screen
it wouldn't have the upper button actions such as pickup
that would be the only place where progress would be shown
some events could be related to production, including all
automatically triggered ones,
while 'shoot' would make more sense on item play instead

prompt before overwriting another action in progress
such as if a character is already doing something else

will it be difficult if several elapsed-time actions depend on each other?
pen requires lid requires plastic, and each is incremented regularly
when querying an item, first recursively query
all of its sources that are in progress
avoid recursion loops by maintaining a set of items to query
the set would need to be a local variable passed as a parameter

the player could control this by playing the source item first
although that wouldn't be obvious at all
going to overview would also take away that choice for top-level items

check for triggered events in overview

are item triggers only for general qty?

automatic trigger chance seems to work well for travel when
checking for every unit of distance
it's unintuitive though
seems like chance should be based on 100% for a full trip or 1 batch
could we set the chance that way but somehow still check each step?
divide chance by distance, then what,
multiply by distance so far that we haven't counted yet?

don't allow production if byproducts would exceed limit
or maybe allow but don't go past limit, and prefer no limit

in overall settings we could set a default location
such as upgrades

---- scenario changes ----

scenario: Bacon
the current way the farm is set up makes it so
pig breeding is easier to see first,
so there's less reason to carelessly butcher

scenario: Dungeon Crawl
animal class, rat
stamina for physical actions
perception
randomly populate room with items to pick up
by running events
chance based on item rarity
or other attrs, for example, some items more likely in fire caves
and others more likely in ice
also randomly populate with monsters
allow only one of each type of item pile at a loc

scenario: Fission Plant
win condition includes no more than a certain amount of pollution
events trigger during production of some recipes
use waste as a determining attr for increased
likelihood of bigger problem
chance could improve with upgrades

scenario: Furniture
People: old man, young husband, young wife, elementary schooler, baby, dog, cat
