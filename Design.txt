networked web game
could play competitively or as a team
store code in github

various scenarios to start the board
partially procedurally generated
choose goal

no matter what the scenario, there will be a list of the following entities:
    overview -- scenario description and win requirements
    items -- can be used; variety of types such as upgrades, sources
    locations -- e.g. first room to the north
    characters -- player or npc, with select box to specify "user 1" etc
    events -- e.g. axe breaks; random chance that can occur once per second during action
    attributes -- e.g. 100 max hp; also states such as poisoned or 20 hp left

action could be an event, or whatever was the most recent item interacted
with for a particular character, even if the action is finished
username and character in the same row doesn't necessarily mean that character
is a player character
all ongoing progress actions have a swirling icon next to the action name

    character   location    action  player
    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~    ~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~
    Suzy        Home        Ink     mycoolusername
    George      Woods       travel  2kul4wrds
                            Pens    userwithoutchar
    Peter       Woods       wolf

icons or other images would add quite a bit of color to the game
characters and items could have icons
locations may even have bigger images, perhaps drawn
what about adding a simple art screen,
with a pencil (adjustable width) and color selection
image sizes for each entity would be fixed, either icon size or image size
of course, that would require more memory, not as scalable

source of resources: obtained from activities in forest which can be
unlimited, regenerates periodically, or fixed limit.
if unlimited, it's equivalent to saying magically produced by an activity,
so we don't actually have a source
but a particular location or crafing station can be required
the action stops if requirement is no longer met
resources could be purchased
realistic would be to start with a debt and eventually break even and better
but can choose to make it easy and simply be given lots of money or resources to start
fixed limit could be used to give an endpoint to the game

sales can increase in complexity as well, adding stores and store management
NPCs can work at stores
items of a single name are unique
so if we want multiple stores, make "store 1", "store 2"
could also divide money into "store 1 money" and "general money"
    and they could require each other to allow transfers

stamina points
train stamina by swimming in pool
each player char has stats (attributes) that are chosen at the beginning of the game
select from a list or specify custom
strength, intelligence, dexterity, stamina (current/max), health (current/max)
perception, athletics
status conditions
states (effects / attributes) may change over time, such as poisoning
turn-based, not with a time delay

different players may be given different authority,
for example, only managers can spend money to open new stores
an easy distinction would be that only the gamemaster can change setup

events can pop up randomly while an action is in progress
sudden bad or good events may also happen
for example, outcome is critical failure, and if scenario is trees, lose lots of logs
trigger chance is in settings, can be 0 to turn off
for example, 1 out of 100 chance
before the event is shown, event params are shown which can either be
accepted or changed, and then roll for the event
no random event can occur when progress is paused

randomized progress
for example if str is 10 then hit on tree is from 8 to 10
chance of success for incrementing
optionally manual rather than auto increment, like manually attempting to chop a tree
can select a failure event from a dropdown list
event chance may depend on stats (attributes) of characters or items involved

radio in config specifies that the type is four-way outcome, on by default
radio2: outcome is a number -- specify min and max
    useful in combat, adding more functionality later such as
    calculating based on attributes
radio3: selected list -- can select a list of other entities to randomly choose from
    on the configure screen
radio4: entered list -- enter a list of strings of outcomes to randomly choose from
    on the configure screen
    for example, we might want to ask which of 5 doors to enter,
    or which of 5 names to choose

scenarios can be randomly generated except number of players must be specified
setting up the configuration one question at a time could be tedious
perhaps the questions could be all in a list
for quality of life, could have the ability to copy info from one entity to another
so an entity could be used like a template
maybe specify a list of which attrs to copy
call it templating or copying
each entity perhaps would have a template e.g. all characters in this scenario have int
or simply allow duplicating

keep track of how many produced (for xp) as well as how many in inventory
age could be similar to xp, increasing over time

can set a win condition to defeat a boss
ability to replay a game

quantity may be unlimited
items may have different sets of materials
for example, wood could come from a log or from disassembling a shelf
or by purchasing
On item screen, specify max number of items gainable.
this could be useful for unique items, where max is 1. 

to cover more cases, we'd need to differentiate between materials and contained items.
for example, a wooden box requires planks and nails to build, but could contain clothes.
or perhaps only locations need to contain things, and a wooden box could be a location
    it may still be possible to build a location, perhaps by brute force with an event
    we could manufacture a wooded box item, then destroy it and create the unique location
characters (players and npcs) could also contain (i.e. wear or hold) items

entity classes might have superclasses for partially shared behavior
    players and npcs are both actors and can potentially gain xp from an action
    items and locations can both have a position, such as inside another one
    items and characters can be incremented over time

perhaps the database is only needed for persistence
or maybe store the game with JSON rather than in a database
store client-side in browser with downloadable JSON?
would that work for multiplayer?

global stop button on overview screen, but no other ability to manufacture anything

likely too, no items are top-level, but rather locations,
perhaps a backpack or chest,
and clicking on it would show its contents.
a room could serve this purpose as well, containing npcs for example.
locations could require travel time, similar to any other incremental
or at least, they require going through place 1 and 2 in order to get to place 3

travel could optionally take a resource such as food for each distance step
the character object would have this food

attributes would be the main thing determining event chances,
and attributes could be members of characters, items, or top-level
or maybe not top-level, but special items could be added that could
hold such attributes, for example a calendar item with a season attribute
would they be useful for locations?
for example, how dark a room is,
or deep water would require swimming or limit evasion
perhaps it would be better to simply mention such things in location description

one attribute would be max hp
another would be current hp
a third would be poison duration remaining
then there would need to be a next turn in a fight where these are possibly changed
perhaps the turn would be an event
the event would calculate a random hp change based on attributes and items
current hp would be selected as an attribute to modify
items would have their own attrs list,
including e.g. hp change that would indicate how much of an
impact it would have in increasing or reducing hp change of the event
perhaps basic mechanics could be implemented automatically,
and more advanced mechanics would require manual changes to stats
armor could be dmg * 0.95, or chance to get hit * 0.95

base chances could be displayed in the form of 1 / 10000 ticks
or 3 / 5 chance to hit
also min and max result,
for example, 70% chance to do between 30 and 60 damage.

for example, an attribute could be the season
so an event based on the season would have a worse chance or lower average
distance if season is winter
winter would be explained in the attr description,
and the implementation would be an input box showing * 0.9

the attr obj would be damage reduction,
perhaps somehow specifying that values are meant to be multipliers,
(that could be explained in the description at least),
and a piece of armor would have value 0.9 as the multiplier
maybe multiplier would be one of several radio button options explaining what
kind of stat it is
an attr could possibly also reference another attr that is used to change it,
for example, hp change could be affected by damage reduction

in a fighting event,
all factors should be displayed to show how the outcome is arrived at

perhaps one event could contain references to other (sub-)events,
for example, an attack would be a chance of changing hp
as well as a chance at poisoning

chances could be at a disadvantage (lowest of two rolls)
or advantage (highest of two roles) based on story context

during encounters, time is turn-based and rotational,
at other times, it is much freer


---- scenarios ----

cut down trees to build a raft
or swim across
or build a bridge

scenario: factory
either maximize profits or products
what to build is completely customizable, but suggestions are given
    automobiles of perhaps a new or sci-fi kind, such as walkers a bit like in Hoth
    sandwiches, pies, pizzas -- perhaps more of a kitchen than factory
currency name: credits
can customize currency name, or choose from a list

scenario: fight enemies

scenario: hunting for food, like UnReal World

scenario: build house
various rooms
perhaps goal would be best house, compete but outcome is subjective

scenario: race
perhaps track meet

scenario: you have been contracted to produce as much as possible with x resources
the client is willing to provide better tools in exchange for some products

farm: breeding
traits

scenario: travel by train from chennai to dehradun
limited money
during a strike and an election, so many things might go wrong
or possibly allow other forms of transportation: bus, plane, auto, taxi
english, tamil, hindi - transliterated?
encounter with cross-dressers begging
buy food
train may break down or be full and have to change
navigate train station with coolies and boarding
sleep is a resource -- too low gives rolls disadvantage

scenario: back to the future, or body switching
have a certain goal to fix
scenario: typical d&d ruleset

dropdown list of scenarios selectable by their title

scenario enhancement: Pen Factory
include it as a packaged scenario
no characters
maximums, which can be increased with upgrades
other upgrades increase efficiency,
but require upgrading maximums before they can be purchased
description of upgrades explains how to use them, i.e. manually

scenario enhancement: Bacon for Dinner
pigs require pigs as source, 2 => 3.
if less than 2, then will have to earn money doing farm chores in
order to get enough to buy another pig.
requires minimum 2 pigs to win
so multiple sources will be required.
phone is an item, or at least an event
Mom is also included from the start

to travel from one location to another, selecting from a dropdown may
be a bit tedious
could have buttons instead to start travelling to a location
perhaps we could use those instead of a single start button
would still have a single stop button
only a single distance display as well
maybe display would include destination name: "Distance to Home: 3 of 10"
since button would simply show "Travelling."
other buttons would be greyed out if travelling.

limit running progress objects to 10 concurrent per session.
