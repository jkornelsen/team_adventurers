---- overview ----

The basic steps are to download, install and configure python
and a postgres database. Then start the app.

I'm not sure if this will be too hard for most people or not.
It should be fine for those who have worked in programming
or system administration.
But even people who just regularly play computer games may have developed
enough skills to install, run commands, and edit configuration files.

Commands are given using powershell syntax on windows,
but the software should run on other systems such as Linux
with only minimal adjustments, such as not needing "&" to run something.

---- python virtual environment ----

If your system doesn't have it yet, download and install python.

Now, open a command line. Admin rights are not required to set up a venv.
chdir team_progress/app
rm -Path ./venv -Recurse -Force
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install flask
pip show flask
pip install flask-caching
pip install psycopg2
pip install bleach

---- install database ----

Download and run PostgreSQL EDB installer.
chdir team_progress/app
& "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/bin/pg_ctl" initdb -U postgres -D postgres_data
& "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/bin/createuser" --superuser postgres

---- start database and rebuild tables ----

& "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/bin/pg_ctl" start -D postgres_data
& "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/bin/psql" -U postgres -d app

create database app with encoding 'UTF8' template template0;
drop schema public cascade; create schema public;
python database.py
\pset pager off

---- reload app ----

chdir team_progress/app
venv/Scripts/activate
python app.py
Open a web browser to http://localhost:5000 
If it works, you're ready to play!

---- database password ----

For running on a LAN, trust authentication is fine.
Otherwise, set a password as follows.
Rename app/sensitive.example.py to app/sensitive.py and edit to change DB_PASSWORD.
alter user postgres with password 'your_password';
Edit pg_hba.conf to remove trust:
local   all             all                                     md5
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
