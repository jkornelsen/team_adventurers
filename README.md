# Team Progress: incremental + TTRPG
----

Produce, interact, and explore&mdash;modelling a wide variety of ideas.
Like in tabletop RPGs, the driving forces are storytelling and chance.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

The setup section is often considered part of playing.
For example, if you know what a value ought to be but there isn't
any clear way to do it, go to settings and force the change,
then describe what happened.

For solo RPGs, it helps to track the narrative in a
text document rather than only looking at what is displayed.

The flexible, multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as pythonAnywhere can host this type of project.
Another option is to download and run on a home network.
To do that, see [Installing](Installation.md).
