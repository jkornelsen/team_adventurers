# Team Progress &mdash; ttRPG + incremental

So, you can make stuff as well as fight and explore.
Like in tabletop RPGs,
the driving forces are narrative and imagination along with chance.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

Setup is often part of playing rather than separate.
For example, as the group enters a town, talk about what could
be there and set it up accordingly.
And if you know what a value should be but there isn't
any clear way to do it, go to settings and force the change.

There is a log of events similar to roguelikes.
However, results are subject to interpretation by the Gamemaster.
Communicate the narrative remotely using a chat app such as Discord.
For solo RPGs, a text document works well.

The flexible, multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as pythonAnywhere can host this type of project.
Another option is to download and run on a home network.
To do that, see [Installing](Installation.md).
