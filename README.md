# Team Progress
A project I'm working on with heavy aid from ChatGPT to learn about technologies such as AJAX and Flask.

Some people have expressed concerns about AI as a coding aid because it often doesn't produce good quality code, not to mention accidentally creating clever bugs.
So far, I've found that it can be useful to do a lot of the rough drafting,
including what amounts to an advanced search and replace based on context.
I often ask it to suggest ideas for potential solutions.
It can also answer certain questions pretty well,
such as explaining how something works,
making it easier for me to make informed decisions or get information I had forgotten,
arguably with less effort than online research would require.

There are plenty of annoyances. Often there's just no way to get it to
do what you want, and sometimes,
the process takes much longer than it should due to going on rabbit trails.
So it requires firm control to be worthwhile.


## Ideas for a release message &mdash; if that ever happens

Team Progress -- inspired by tRPGs
----

Similar to a tabletop RPG,
the driving forces are narrative and imagination along with chance.
However, idle/incremental elements are also involved.
For example, you could set it up to manage a factory,
and employees from a rival company might suddenly invade
and attempt to steal equipment or trade secrets.

This was conceived as a group game,
although there is a reason idle games are typically single player.
Multiplayer generally requires a lot to be handled by the server,
and many sites do not offer the required infrastructure.
So, a good way to play is to download the source code and
run as a home LAN server with friends or family.
There are some websites such as pythonAnywhere that can host
this type of game for free,
so we'll see if it can handle the load.
