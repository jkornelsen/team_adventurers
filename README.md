# Team Progress
A project I'm working on with heavy aid from ChatGPT to learn about technologies such as AJAX and Flask.

Some people have expressed concerns about AI as a coding aid because it often doesn't produce good quality code, not to mention accidentally creating clever bugs.
So far, I've found that it can be useful to do a lot of the rough drafting,
including what amounts to an advanced search and replace based on context.
I often ask it to suggest ideas for potential solutions.
It can also answer certain questions pretty well,
such as explaining how something works,
making it easier to make informed decisions or get information I had forgotten,
arguably with less effort than online research would require.

There are plenty of annoyances. Often there's just no way to get it to
do what you want, and sometimes,
the process takes much longer than it should due to going on rabbit trails.
So it requires firm control to be worthwhile.

Team Progress &mdash; ttRPG + incremental
----

So, you can make stuff as well as fight and explore.

Similar to a tabletop RPG,
the driving forces are narrative and imagination along with chance.
For example, set up a factory based on idle/incremental gameplay,
and employees from a rival company could invade and steal.

If you're not sure where to start,
try the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

Setup can be complex,
so even if you're playing as a Gamemaster,
it might be better to do most of the setup as the game progresses
instead of beforehand.
Consider setup screens a part of the game.

This was conceived for groups,
although there is a reason idle games are typically single player.
Multiplayer requires a lot to be handled by the server.
So, a good way to play this game is to download the project
along with PostgreSQL and Flask,
then run them on a home network to play with friends or family.

There are some websites such as pythonAnywhere that can host
this type of game for free,
so we'll see if it can handle the load.
