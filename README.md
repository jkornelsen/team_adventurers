# Team Progress: incremental + TTRPG

Produce, interact, and explore&mdash;modelling a wide variety of ideas.
Like in tabletop RPGs, the driving forces are storytelling and chance.
For those who like to create their own characters
or figure out how idler values impact progress.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

The setup section is often considered part of playing.
If you know what a value ought to be but there isn't
any clear way to do it, go to settings and force the change,
then describe what happened.
For solo campaigns, it helps to track the narrative in a
document.

## Server

The multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as pythonAnywhere can host this type of project.
To download and run on a home network, see [Installing](Installation.md).
