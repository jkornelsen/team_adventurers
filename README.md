# Team Progress &mdash; ttRPG + incremental
----

So, you can make stuff as well as fight and explore.

Similar to a tabletop RPG,
the driving forces are narrative and imagination along with chance.
For example, set up a factory based on idle/incremental gameplay,
but employees from a rival company invade and steal.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

Setting up beforehand can take awhile.
Instead, even if you're the Gamemaster,
it might be better to do as the game progresses.
For example, as the group enters a forest, talk about what could
be there and set it up accordingly.
Some things might even need to change halfway through a fight,
as the situation becomes clearer.

The original idea was to work like an idler such as Universal Paperclips.
However, the flexible, multiplayer design
has made it a somewhat different kind of game. It doesn't idle as smoothly
but is surprisingly good at storytelling.

This design requires more on the server side.
There are some websites such as pythonAnywhere that can host
this type of project for free,
so we'll see how it handles the load.

Otherwise, consider downloading the project
to run on a home network and forming a team of friends or family.
For details, see [Installing](Installation.md).
