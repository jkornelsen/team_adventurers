    <h1>Enter Username</h1>
    <p>Can either be a new one or the name you've been using for this game.
    <p>This is your ID to access the game,
    not the name of your player's character.
    For example, your username could be tom123
    while the main character you play might be named "Thunderfist Joe".</p>
    <p>If you're playing this game on the internet instead of a LAN,
    then it's best to avoid giving personal information.</p>
