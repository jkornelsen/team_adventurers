win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur while progress is running
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange
