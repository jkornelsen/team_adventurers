win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur while progress is running
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange

Use GameData to load everything,
which will also be useful for JSON file serialization.
The user_interactions table wouldn't go into the file or
be part of GameData.
When loading GameData, perhaps we wouldn't need to select join the far
side of relation tables, because we could join to the near side and
then use get_by_id() in python to get the object reference.
Joining relation tables fully might be useful when only grabbing specific
information.

for /configure/item/:
    query to select all items and their progress data
        only need to get progress data for current item
    query to select all attribute name and id and whether attached to current item
    add attached attrs to current item object data
    create all attribute objects by calling from_json() with only name and id
        use dict.get('field', '') to handle unspecified vals
        i.e. partial loading
        the list is held by game_data
    query to select id and quantity of all source items for current item
    add attached sources to current item object data
    create item object using from_json()
