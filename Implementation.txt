A character starts in location 1, must go to location 3, get an item there, then return to location 1. To go to a destination, a character must be in one of the allowable source locations. On item screen, specify max number of items gainable, for example, 1.

win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

implement events as four-outcome or chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur
during a timer action
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

to start with, implement attributes as manual only,
not automatically affecting event chances or outcomes
would need to manually adjust event chances based on attrs involved
