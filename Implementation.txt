Currently, item progress can only be done in general storage,
even though items can also be owned by a character or at a location.
The issue is that progress.quantity is used for general storage.
General storage should be in items.quantity instead,
and progress.quantity could be used for quantity anywhere.
Because loc_items and char_items each have their own quantity field already.
I guess it's okay that they would all share the same limit?
Or maybe there should never be a limit on the floor.
