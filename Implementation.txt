---- Goals ----

win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur while progress is running
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange


---- TODO Upcoming ----

In item.py, the following code expects Item.recipes to be a dict,
but it is (now) a list:
            if source_data.recipe_id:
                if (recipe := instance.recipes.get(source_data.recipe_id)) is None:
                    recipe = Recipe.from_json(source_data)
                    instance.recipes[source_data.recipe_id] = recipe
                recipe.sources[source_data.source_id] = source_data.src_qty
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'
To fix, either create a separate dict to help combine the values correctly,
or insert the values into the array sequentially.

Configure Locations.
Configure Characters.
Test serializing recipes and win requirements.
