A character starts in location 1, must go to location 3, get an item there, then return to location 1. To go to a destination, a character must be in one of the allowable source locations. On item screen, specify max number of items gainable, for example, 1.

win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

implement events as four-outcome or chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur
during a timer action
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

to start with, implement attributes as manual only,
not automatically affecting event chances or outcomes
would need to manually adjust event chances based on attrs involved


---- Issues ----

Allow exchange rates of better than 1,
for example, sell 1 pen for 5 crypto.
Would look like this: [__] pens (source items) for [__] (current items).
For multiple source sets, the gain number would need to be the same for the whole set.
Could have this automatically change, or else, have one control for the whole set.

If an item is modified, be sure to stop it from production first.
Whether it needs to be restarted or not is unclear.

Start and Stop buttons should only be one button, whichever changes the action.

Will probably need to fix Character item reference serialization in the
same way that we fixed Location destinations and Item sources.
