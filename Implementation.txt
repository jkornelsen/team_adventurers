show containing char/loc on item play screen
recipe requires item such as knife in same location as other source items
to determine the current location, navigate first to the location play page,
or character play page
then remember the location when we arrive at the produced item page

That can be used instead of a source for e.g. chores.
Then make sure it can serialize that way.
