---- TODO sometime ----

Test win requirement results on Overview screen.
Progress should use nearest quantity field available.

Character travel progress should show automatically if
another window initiated the travel.

Auto start event if triggered.

actions log

show containing char/loc on item play screen
recipe requires item such as knife in same location as other source items
to determine the current location, navigate first to the location play page,
or character play page
then remember the location when we arrive at the produced item page

Bars instead of second counts as main progress indicator.
Total number of seconds can be viewed in setup screen.
Perhaps mouseover on the bar could also show numeric details.
Instead of travel Distance: 0 of 1 (Elapsed 0:00),
say Distance 1 and then the progress bar.

Allow recipes to only require attribute, not source.
That can be used instead of a source for e.g. chores.
Then make sure it can serialize that way.

---- TODO Upcoming ----

---- Issues ----

Checkmark doesn't appear with 30 cooked bacon.
Cooked bacon goes to general inventory.

JSON shows quantity attr for items as well as progress
maybe should only be under progress?

Suzy's items in JSON got duplicated
