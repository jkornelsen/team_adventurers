win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur while progress is running
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange

two things i want to do that haven't been explained in the docs yet:
1. many-to-many relationship with composite foreign key
Foreign keys may also be defined at the table level, using the ForeignKeyConstraint object.
It’s important to note that the ForeignKeyConstraint is the only way to define a composite foreign key.
This object can describe a single- or multi-column foreign key. 
,
    ForeignKeyConstraint(
        ["invoice_id", "ref_num"], ["invoice.invoice_id", "invoice.ref_num"]
    ),
To apply table-level constraint objects such as ForeignKeyConstraint to a table defined using Declarative, use the __table_args__ attribute.

2. many-to-many relationship (which means using an association table) where the other side can be several different classes, perhaps siblings


---- Issues ----

Going to play_item resulted in item not found. Reloading the page caused
the item to be found. Maybe data didn't get loaded from db at the right time?
