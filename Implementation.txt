win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur during a timer action
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

to start with, implement attributes as manual only,
not automatically affecting event chances or outcomes
would need to manually adjust event chances based on attrs involved

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange


---- Issues ----

Progress is yielding too many results in some cases, maybe doubling.

Watching progress every second isn't smooth enough.
Perhaps send AJAX request every 0.5 seconds.

Stop travel didn't work.
