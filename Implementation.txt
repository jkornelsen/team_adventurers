win requirement: character has a certain item
win requirement: character is in a certain location
all conditions must be met to win

chance of 1 out of x ticks to randomly occur while progress is running
e.g. chance of beast showing up during suzy's trip through the forest

require character in location for item progress
that means on /play/item, we would need to select a character to do the exchange
so add a dropdown list of characters on that screen
also require worn item
maybe have a checkbox that the item won't get consumed during the exchange

Maybe use GameData to load everything,
which will also be useful for JSON file serialization.
The user_interactions table wouldn't go into the file or
be part of GameData.
When loading GameData, perhaps we wouldn't need to select join the far
side of relation tables, because we could join to the near side and
then use get_by_id() in python to get the object reference.
Joining relation tables fully might be useful when only grabbing specific
information.

TODO next:
    In overall.get_char_list_display(),
        recent_interactions() needs to return objects with action_name attr.
        List of UserInteraction objects.
        This requires first obtaining action_type,
        then getting the name from those objects.
        First call GameData to load_list_from_db() for all entities.
        Well, we could optimize a bit by excluding events and attribs perhaps.
        Then for each interaction, reference its action object with get_by_id().

Add code to insert relationships and make them work.
